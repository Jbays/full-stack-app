#Full Stack Application
Using React, Redux, Node, and MongoDb.

##TDD
I will write my tests first.

##Documentation
I will document my code.

###tests
cd to the testing directory.  Then run:
`npm run test`

What happens after the command?
1. Jest test runner starts.
2. Jest finds all files ending in `.test.js`.  Then executes all found tests.
3. To the terminal, Jest prints out all test results.
4. Jest waits for a file to change.  Then will run all tests again.
